 ### Hi there!

My name is Rodrigo and I'm a Brazilian Electronics Technician and Computer Engineer.\
I'm very passionate about all things embedded, and some other random things in between.\
I've built my own home lab in 2016 to study embedded systems and since 2021 I've been documenting my projects online.

My main channel is a Brazilian channel dedicated to engineering and embedded systems:

I also have a secundary channel on youtube in english, that serves me more as a repository, with some engineering things and silly stuff:
