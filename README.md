### Hi there!

My name is Rodrigo and I'm a Brazilian Electronics Technician and Computer Engineer with a hardware emphasis.\
I've built my own home lab in 2016 in order to study Embedded Systems and since 2021 I've been documenting my projects online.\
I'm passionate about engineering and music as it can be seen by my projects.
Currently working on drones and synthesizers.
