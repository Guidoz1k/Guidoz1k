## Hi there!

My name is Rodrigo and I'm a Brazilian Electronics Technician and Computer Engineer with a hardware emphasis.\
I've built my own home lab in 2016 in order to study Embedded Systems and since 2021 I've been documenting my projects online.\
I'm passionate about engineering and music as it can be seen by my projects.

## My projects

Every repository will contain all documentation and links to my video repository on youtube.

[MadSynth](https://github.com/Guidoz1k/MadSynth), a microcontroller based synthesizer.

more projects to come in 2022 as I'll finally become an engineer.\
As soon as I get my degree I'll start documenting past project as well as starting new ones.
