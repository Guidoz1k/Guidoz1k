 ### Hi there!

My name is Rodrigo and I'm a Brazilian Electronics Technician and Computer Engineer.\
I'm very passionate about all things embedded, and some other random things in between.\
I've built my own home lab in 2016 to study embedded systems and since 2021 I've been documenting my projects online.\
For the time being, I have a provisory channel on youtube as a repository, with content ranging from engineering to silly videos:

Feel free to check my videos or hit me up on LinkedIn:

And if you like simulator games, I have a long format gameplay channel:
